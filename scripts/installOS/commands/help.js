    "Hello! Welcome to the AboveLime Kernel! This is in the installOS sector where you get to install your operating system! This is built on my bad javascript code and is really unreliable. Project is on GitHub. Use the command, 'installos installer' to start the installer! If you know the operating system you want, you can use 'installos ' and then the operating system. For a list of operating systems, do 'installos list'.  Thanks for tuning in! AboveLime - Liam",
